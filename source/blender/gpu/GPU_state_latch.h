/*
OpenGL ES does not have state query functions for some state.

These functions latch the value passed to them,
so that the current value can be queried later by a distance piece of code.

Of course, this requires disciplined use of the correct function, so
these functions these replace should be include the gpu_deprecated.h header,
even if they aren't officially deprecated.

If it makes sense to move one of these functions to another module, then do so,
they have nothing else in common besides the need for state query.
